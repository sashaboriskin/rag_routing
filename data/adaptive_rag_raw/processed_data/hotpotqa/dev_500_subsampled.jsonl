The number of authorized translations is not equal to the number of languages because there have been multiple authorized translations into the same language. Specifically, there have been two separate translations into each of: Mandarin Chinese, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian and Turkish (5 languages).

The black washerwoman, Nancy Mannigoe, fears that her common-law husband Jesus is seeking to murder her because she is pregnant with a white man's child.

If a pacemaker other than the sinoatrial node is pacing the heart, this condition is known as an escape rhythm.

In a typical ESTASI process, a droplet of a protic solvent containing analytes is deposited on a sample area of interest which itself is mounted to an insulating substrate. Under this substrate and right below the droplet, an electrode is placed and connected with a pulsed high voltage (HV) to electrostatically charge the droplet during pulsing. When the electrostatic pressure is larger than the surface tension, droplets and ions are sprayed. ESTASI is a contactless process based on capacitive coupling. One advantage of ESTASI is, that the electrode and sample droplet act contact-less avoiding thereby any oxidation or reduction of the sample compounds at the electrode surface, which often happens during standard electrospray ionization (ESI). ESTASI is a powerful new ambient ionization technique that has already found many applications in the detection of different analytes, such as organic molecules, peptides and proteins with molecule weight up to 70 kDa.

Initially, those harmonies were major and minor triads; subsequently, neo-Riemannian theory was extended to standard dissonant sonorities as well. Harmonic proximity is characteristically gauged by efficiency of voice leading. Thus, C major and E minor triads are close by virtue of requiring only a single semitonal shift to move from one to the other. Motion between proximate harmonies is described by simple transformations. For example, motion between a C major and E minor triad, in either direction, is executed by an \"L\" transformation. Extended progressions of harmonies are characteristically displayed on a geometric plane, or map, which portrays the entire system of harmonic relations. Where consensus is lacking is on the question of what is most central to the theory: smooth voice leading, transformations, or the system of relations that is mapped by the geometries.

The 1847 Act was passed soon after the fall from power of Sir Robert Peel's Conservative government, but the fiercest opponents of all ten-hour bills were the 'free trade' Liberals such as John Bright; the economic doctrines that led them to object to artificial tariff barriers also led them to object to government restricting the terms on which a man might sell his labour, and to extend that objection to women and young persons.", "is_supporting": false}, {"idx": 9, "title": "Swedish Work Environment Authority", "paragraph_text": "The Swedish Work Environment Authority (SWEA) (Swedish: \"Arbetsmilj\u00f6verket\" , abbreviated \"AV\") is a Swedish administrative authority sorting under the Ministry of Employment, responsible for issues relating to the working environment and work injury statistics.

In other words, the equivalent formulation is racism multiplied by sexism multiplied by classism.\" - Deborah K. King Multiple Jeopardy stems off the term double jeopardy, which when used from a sociological perspective, refers to the additional obstacles individuals face when exposed to multiple disadvantages due to their unique being. When considering double jeopardy, often times there is an emphasis on just two aspects such as race and gender. An example of this would be the rights observed by black women. Not only are these individuals oppressed because they are female, but also because they are black. These women are a part of a dual oppressive system and are not only hindered by one trait, but by two. \u201cNot only are colored women . . . handicapped on account of their sex, but they are almost everywhere baffled and mocked because of their race. Not only because they are women, but because they are colored women.\" \u2013 Mary Church Terrell\u201cAs blacks they suffer all the burdens of prejudice and mistreatment that fall on anyone with dark skin. As women they bear the additional burden of having to cope with white and black men.\" -Frances M. BealMultiple jeopardy differs from double jeopardy, by the fact that instead of just two factors playing into the disadvantages of individuals, there are multiple. Three common factors that are often observed are the factors of race, class, and gender. In Deborah King\u2019s article, \"Multiple Jeopardy, Multiple Consciousness: The Context of a Black Feminist Ideology\", she recounts the ill treatment of black women during the slavery era. During the slavery time period in America, all black people were subjected to demanding physical labor and harsh brutal punishments; this was due to their race and their class, or their position in society. However, what sets black women slaves apart is the fact that they often endured struggles that were only subjected to women, namely rape (King). As Angela Davis put it in her book \"Women, Race, and Class\", \u201cIf the most violent punishments of men consisted in floggings and mutilations, women were flogged and mutilated, as well as raped.\" In this scenario, black women could not identify with black males due to their gender and sexuality, nor could they identify with the sexual oppression of white women due to their race and class.", "is_supporting": false}]}

It is a 20kDa protein whose structure is made up of beta strands forming 2 beta sheets to form a Greek key beta barrel with variable alpha helical structure. The copper binding domain of the protein is located at the amino-terminal end, while the carboxyl-terminal end is rich in hydroxyproline and serine residues, typical of proteins associated with cell walls of plants.

The glutamine residue takes place of a methione ligand typically found in other blue copper proteins.

Heavy fermion materials have a low-temperature specific heat whose linear term is up to 1000 times larger than the value expected from the free-electron theory. The properties of the heavy fermion compounds often derive from the partly filled f-orbitals of rare-earth or actinide ions, which behave like localized magnetic moments.

In the case of electrons, below a characteristic temperature (typically 10\u00a0K), the conduction electrons in these metallic compounds behave as if they had an effective mass up to 1000 times the free-electron mass.

The group was started by Ezra Cline and Curly Ray Cline and was originally named \"Cousin Ezra and the Lonesome Pine Fiddlers\". The Clines came from a large family consisting of musically talented people. Ray and Charlie's father, Charlie, was a talented banjo player and the women in the family, Geraldine and Bobbi, were great singers. For reasons unknown, Bobbi and Geraldine never joined the band on the road but often joined in at home, especially when notable Country singers, such as Bill Monroe, Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs, and Hank Williams, came visiting. None of them ever had a music lesson yet excelled on every instrument they touched. Natives of the Gilbert Creek region of southern West Virginia, Cousin Ezra, along with brothers Ireland (Lazy Ned) and Curly Ray Cline, were part of the original Lonesome Pine Fiddlers from about 1938, a group that worked on radio at WHIS Bluefield, West Virginia. During World War II, Ned was killed in action. When the Pine Fiddlers resumed regular daily broadcasts, Charlie, who played multiple instruments, joined them on a regular basis. Charlie returned to the Fiddlers briefly before becoming a member of Bill Monroe's Blue Grass Boys. During 1952-1955, Charlie worked off and on with Monroe, recording some 38 songs, all on Decca. It has been said that he played every instrument at one time or another in the Monroe group except mandolin. Charlie spent most of 1953 back with the Lonesome Pine Fiddlers working at WJR radio in Detroit. When Ezra brought the band to Pikeville, Kentucky, in November, Charlie rejoined Bill Monroe. In 1954, Charlie did a session, playing lead guitar, with the Stanley Brothers and also another one on RCA with the Fiddlers, although he was not otherwise working with them at the time. He also worked briefly as a sideman with the Osborne Brothers, although he did not record with them. By 1958, Charlie (electric lead guitar) and his wife, Lee (electric bass), had rejoined Ezra and Curly Ray in the Lonesome Pine Fiddlers, who were experimenting with a more modern sound and working a TV show in Huntington, West Virginia, in addition to daily radio in Pikeville. In his later years, Charlie was with the Stanley Brothers. Curly Ray also played with the Stanley Brothers at a different time as their fiddler. Curly Ray was one of the best fiddlers in Bluegrass.

Notes again.\" In entries dated from November 20 to December 3, 1953, he made notes on \"Lucien Midnight\" which was to be originally conceptualized in what he called \"book movie\" form, when he closed his eyes and projected onto paper a cinematic sense of what he heard. A bookmovie, he explained in Some of the Dharma, is a \"prose concentration camera-eye visions of a definite movie of the mind with fade-ins, pans, close-ups, and fade-outs.\" Kerouac's notes on Lucien Midnight were written while staying in the Lower East Side where he initially heard sounds coming through a tenement window from the wash court below. He then heard voices coming from kitchens of the other occupants in nearby apartment buildings and a man named Paddy arriving home drunk, and even a junky stirring in his bed. Kerouac conceptualized an idea of developing a work based on James Joyce\u2019s experimental novel \"Finnegans Wake\" (not \"Ulysses\" as indicated by Ann Charters in her introduction to \"Old Angel Midnight\" for Grey Fox Press) where the \u201csounds of the universe\u201d became the chief \u201cplot\u201d with all of its associated \u201cneologisms, mental associations, puns and wordmixes\u201d that stewed a plethora of languages and \u201cnonlanguages.\u201d Kerouac determinedly \u201cscribbled out in a strictly intuitional discipline at breakneck speed\u201d the fledgling prose that would finally comprise the finished book for City Lights's Pocket Poet series eight years later.
