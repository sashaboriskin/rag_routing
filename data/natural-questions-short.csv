"Interphase is the phase of the cell cycle in which a typical cell spends most of its life . During this phase , the cell copies its DNA in preparation for mitosis .

In bacteria , which lack a cell nucleus , the cell cycle is divided into the B , C , and D periods . The B period extends from the end of cell division to the beginning of DNA replication . DNA replication occurs during the C period . The D period refers to the stage between the end of DNA replication and the splitting of the bacterial cell into two daughter cells .

"A population bottleneck or genetic bottleneck is a sharp reduction in the size of a population due to environmental events ( such as earthquakes , floods , fires , disease , or droughts ) or human activities ( such as genocide ) . Such events can reduce the variation in the gene pool of a population ; thereafter , a smaller population , with a correspondingly smaller genetic diversity , remains to pass on genes to future generations of offspring through sexual reproduction . Genetic diversity remains lower , increasing only when gene flow with another population occurs or very slowly increasing with time as random mutations occur . As a consequence of such population size reductions and the loss of genetic variation , the robustness of the population is reduced and its ability to adapt to and survive selecting environmental changes , like climate change or a shift in available resources , is reduced . Alternatively , if by chance survivors of the bottleneck are the individuals with the greatest genetic fitness , the frequency of the fitter genes within the gene pool is increased , while the pool itself is reduced .",loss of diversity in a reduced population is called,population bottleneck,Genetic drift.,Genetic reduction.

"Education reform is the name given to the goal of changing public education . Historically , reforms have taken different forms because the motivations of reformers have differed . However , since the 1980s , education reform has been focused on changing the existing system from one focused on inputs to one focused on outputs ( i.e. , student achievement ) . In the United States , education reform acknowledges and encourages public education as the primary source of K - 12 education for American youth . Education reformers desire to make public education into a market ( in the form of an input - output system ) , where accountability creates high - stakes from curriculum standards tied to standardized tests . As a result of this input - output system , equality has been conceptualized as an end point , which is often evidenced by an achievement gap among diverse populations . This conceptualization of education reform is based on the market - logic of competition .

"The Gadsden Purchase ( known in Mexico as Spanish : Venta de La Mesilla , `` Sale of La Mesilla '' ) is a 29,670 - square - mile ( 76,800 km ) region of present - day southern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico that the United States purchased via a treaty signed on December 30 , 1853 , by James Gadsden , U.S. ambassador to Mexico at that time . The U.S. Senate voted in favor of ratifying it with amendments on April 25 , 1854 , and then transmitted it to 14th President Franklin Pierce . Mexico 's government and its General Congress or Congress of the Union took final approval action on June 8 , 1854 . The purchase was the last substantial territorial acquisition in the contiguous United States . The U.S. sought the land as a better route for the construction of the southern transcontinental railway line , and the financially - strapped government of Antonio López de Santa Anna agreed to the sale , which netted Mexico $10 million ( equivalent to $4.15 billion in 2016 ) . After the devastating loss of Mexican territory to the U.S. in the Mexican - American War ( 1846 -- 48 ) and the continued filibustering by U.S. citizens , Santa Anna may have calculated it was better to yield territory by treaty and receive payment rather than have the territory simply seized by the U.S.",the land purchased from mexico that today is part of southern arizona and new mexico was called the,Gadsden Purchase,Gadsden Purchase,La Mesilla

"The term endothermic process describes the process or reaction in which the system absorbs energy from its surroundings , usually in the form of heat . The term was coined by Marcellin Berthelot from the Greek roots endo - , derived from the word `` endon '' ( ἔνδον ) meaning `` within '' and the root `` therm '' ( θερμ - ) meaning `` hot '' or `` warm '' intended sense is that of a reaction that depends on absorbing heat if it is to proceed . The opposite of an endothermic process is an exothermic process , one that releases , `` gives out '' energy in the form of heat . Thus in each term ( endothermic & exothermic ) the prefix refers to where heat goes as the reaction occurs , though in reality it only refers to where the energy goes , without necessarily being in the form of heat . All chemical reactions involve both the breaking of existing and the making of new chemical bonds . A reaction to break a bond always requires the input of energy and so such a process is always endothermic . When atoms come together to form new chemical bonds , the electrostatic forces bringing them together leave the bond with a large excess of energy ( usually in the form of vibrations and rotations ) . If that energy is not dissipated , the new bond would quickly break apart again . Instead , the new bond can shed its excess energy - by radiation , by transfer to other motions in the molecule , or to other molecules through collisions - and then become a stable new bond . Shedding this excess energy is the exothermicity that leaves the molecular system . Whether a given overall reaction is exothermic or endothermic is determined by the relative contribution of these bond breaking endothermic steps and new bond stabilizing exothermic steps .",where does the energy in endothermic reactions come from,"from its surroundings , usually in the form of heat",Energy from surroundings.,The energy in endothermic reactions comes from the surroundings.

"The social determinants of health ( SDOH ) are the economic and social conditions and their distribution among the population that influence individual and group differences in health status .

According to some viewpoints , the distributions of social determinants are shaped by public policies that reflect the influence of prevailing political ideologies of those governing a jurisdiction . The World Health Organization says , `` This unequal distribution of health - damaging experiences is not in any sense a ' natural ' phenomenon but is the result of a toxic combination of poor social policies , unfair economic arrangements ( where the already well - off and healthy become even richer and the poor who are already more likely to be ill become even poorer ) , and bad politics .

"The Big Five personality traits , also known as the five factor model ( FFM ) , is a model based on common language descriptors of personality . When factor analysis ( a statistical technique ) is applied to personality survey data , some words used to describe aspects of personality are often applied to the same person . For example , someone described as `` conscientious '' is more likely to be described as `` always prepared '' rather than `` messy '' . This theory is based therefore on the association between words but not on neuropsychological experiments . This theory uses descriptors of common language and therefore suggests five broad dimensions commonly used to describe the human personality and psyche . The five factors have been defined as openness to experience , conscientiousness , extraversion , agreeableness , and neuroticism , often represented by the acronyms OCEAN or CANOE . Beneath each proposed global factor , a number of correlated and more specific primary factors are claimed . For example , extraversion is said to include such related qualities as gregariousness , assertiveness , excitement seeking , warmth , activity , and positive emotions .",identify the 5 key traits in the big five personality model,"openness to experience , conscientiousness , extraversion , agreeableness , and neuroticism","1.

"Australia is one of many countries that have water fluoridation programs currently operating ( see Fluoridation by country ) . As of March 2012 , artificially fluoridated drinking water is provided for 70 % or more of the population in all states and territories . The acceptance of the benefits of water fluoridation occurred in Australia in December 1953 , roughly two years after acceptance in the United States . Many of Australia 's drinking water supplies subsequently began fluoridation in the 1960s and 1970s . By 1984 almost 66 % of the Australian population had access to fluoridated drinking water , represented by 850 towns and cities . Some areas within Australia have natural fluoride levels in the groundwater , which was estimated in 1991 to provide drinking water to approximately 0.9 % of the population .",when was fluoride added to water in australia,in the 1960s and 1970s,Australia: 1962,1953.

"The restriction modification system ( RM system ) is found in bacteria and other prokaryotic organisms , and provides a defense against foreign DNA , such as that borne by bacteriophages . It was first discovered by Salvatore Luria and Mary Human in 1952 and 1953 . They found that bacteriophage growing within an infected bacterium could be modified , so that upon their release and re-infection of a related bacterium the bacteriophage 's growth is restricted ( inhibited ) ( also described by Luria in his autobiography on pages 45 and 99 in 1984 ) . In 1953 , Jean Weigle and Giuseppe Bertani reported similar examples of host - controlled modification using different bacteriophage systems . Later work by Daisy Roulland - Dussoix and Werner Arber in 1962 and many other subsequent workers led to the understanding that restriction was due to attack and breakdown of the modified bacteriophage 's DNA by specific enzymes of the recipient bacteria . As reviewed by Daniel Nathans and Hamilton O. Smith in 1975 , this work resulted in the discovery of the class of enzymes now known as restriction enzymes . When these enzymes were isolated in the laboratory they could be used for controlled manipulation of DNA , thus providing the foundation for the development of genetic engineering . Werner Arber , Daniel Nathans , and Hamilton Smith were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1978 for their work on restriction - modification .",what are produced by bacteria and cut dna at specific points,restriction enzymes,Restriction endonucleases,Restriction enzymes.
"In the United States , a medallion signature guarantee is a special signature guarantee for the transfer of securities . It is a guarantee by the transferring financial institution that the signature is genuine and the financial institution accepts liability for any forgery . Signature guarantees protect shareholders by preventing unauthorized transfers and possible investor losses . They also limit the liability of the transfer agent who accepts the certificates . Not all MSG stamps are of equal value . A special coded prefix is given to each stamp , and this prefix determines how much monetary value can be guaranteed . For instance if the MSG is required for $400,000 worth of value , at least a C prefix is required , which is good for up to $500,000 value . If a D prefix stamp is submitted , the transaction will be rejected , because a D stamp is only good for guarantee up to $250,000 . Often ComputerShare paperwork only informs of a need for a MSG , but does not specify anything about the necessity of certain prefixes .",when do you need a medallion signature guarantee,for the transfer of securities,"What is a Medallion Signature Guarantee?

"Sunlight is a portion of the electromagnetic radiation given off by the Sun , in particular infrared , visible , and ultraviolet light . On Earth , sunlight is filtered through Earth 's atmosphere , and is obvious as daylight when the Sun is above the horizon . When the direct solar radiation is not blocked by clouds , it is experienced as sunshine , a combination of bright light and radiant heat .

"Supernova nucleosynthesis is a theory of the production of many different chemical elements in supernova explosions , first advanced by Fred Hoyle in 1954 . The nucleosynthesis , or fusion of lighter elements into heavier ones , occurs during explosive oxygen burning and silicon burning processes . Those fusion reactions create the elements silicon , sulfur , chlorine , argon , sodium , potassium , calcium , scandium , titanium and iron peak elements : vanadium , chromium , manganese , iron , cobalt , and nickel . These are called `` primary elements '' , in that they can be fused from pure hydrogen and helium in massive stars . As a result of their ejection from supernovae , their abundances increase within the interstellar medium . Elements heavier than nickel are created primarily by a rapid capture of neutrons in a process called the r - process . However , these are much less abundant than the primary chemical elements . Other processes are thought to be responsible for some nucleosynthesis of other such heavy elements , notably , the proton capture process known as the rp - process and a photodisintegration process known as the gamma ( or p ) process . The latter synthesizes the lightest , most neutron - poor , isotopes of the heavy elements .",how does a supernova produce elements heavier than iron,nucleosynthesis,Nuclear fusion.,Rapid neutron capture.

"The three - domain system is a biological classification introduced by Carl Woese et al. in 1977 that divides cellular life forms into archaea , bacteria , and eukaryote domains . In particular , it emphasizes the separation of prokaryotes into two groups , originally called Eubacteria ( now Bacteria ) and Archaebacteria ( now Archaea ) . Woese argued that , on the basis of differences in 16S rRNA genes , these two groups and the eukaryotes each arose separately from an ancestor with poorly developed genetic machinery , often called a progenote . To reflect these primary lines of descent , he treated each as a domain , divided into several different kingdoms . Woese initially used the term `` kingdom '' to refer to the three primary phylogenic groupings , and this nomenclature was widely used until the term `` domain '' was adopted in 1990 .",who proposed the idea that cells can be classified in one of three major groups,Carl Woese et al.,Theodor Schwann,Carl Woese.

"Impeachment in the United States is an enumerated power of the legislature that allows formal charges to be brought against a civil officer of government for crimes alleged to have been committed . Most impeachments have concerned alleged crimes committed while in office , though there have been a few cases in which Congress has impeached and convicted officials partly for prior crimes . The actual trial on such charges , and subsequent removal of an official upon conviction , is separate from the act of impeachment itself . Impeachment proceedings have been initiated against several presidents of the United States . Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton are the only two presidents to have been successfully impeached by the House of Representatives , and both were later acquitted by the Senate . The impeachment process against Richard Nixon was never completed , as Nixon resigned his office before the vote of the full House for impeachment , but such a vote was widely expected to pass , and the threat of it and a subsequent conviction in the Senate was the impetus for Nixon 's departure . To date , no president has been removed from office by impeachment and conviction .

"Binomial nomenclature ( `` two - term naming system '' ) also called binominal nomenclature ( `` two - name naming system '' ) or binary nomenclature , is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts , both of which use Latin grammatical forms , although they can be based on words from other languages . Such a name is called a binomial name ( which may be shortened to just `` binomial '' ) , a binomen , binominal name or a scientific name ; more informally it is also called a Latin name . The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs ; the second part -- the specific name or specific epithet -- identifies the species within the genus . For example , humans belong to the genus Homo and within this genus to the species Homo sapiens . Tyrannosaurus rex is probably the most widely known binomial . The formal introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus , effectively beginning with his work Species Plantarum in 1753 .

The Earth 's surface lithosphere , which rides atop the asthenosphere ( the two components of the upper mantle ) , is divided into a number of plates that are continuously being created and consumed at their opposite plate boundaries . Accretion occurs as mantle is added to the growing edges of a plate , associated with seafloor spreading . This hot added material cools down by conduction and convection of heat .

"A prime number ( or a prime ) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself . A natural number greater than 1 that is not a prime number is called a composite number . For example , 5 is prime because 1 and 5 are its only positive integer factors , whereas 6 is composite because it has the divisors 2 and 3 in addition to 1 and 6 . The fundamental theorem of arithmetic establishes the central role of primes in number theory : any integer greater than 1 is either a prime itself or can be expressed as a product of primes that is unique up to ordering . The uniqueness in this theorem requires excluding 1 as a prime because one can include arbitrarily many instances of 1 in any factorization , e.g. , 3 , 1 3 , 1 1 3 , etc. are all valid factorizations of 3 .",why is 1 not the smallest prime number,"because one can include arbitrarily many instances of 1 in any factorization , e.g. , 3 , 1 3 , 1 1 3 , etc. are all valid factorizations of 3",1 is not prime.,Because one can include arbitrarily many instances of 1 in any factorization.

"An electron transport chain ( ETC ) is a series of complexes that transfer electrons from electron donors to electron acceptors via redox ( both reduction and oxidation occurring simultaneously ) reactions , and couples this electron transfer with the transfer of protons ( H ions ) across a membrane . This creates an electrochemical proton gradient that drives the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) , a molecule that stores energy chemically in the form of highly strained bonds . The molecules of the chain include peptides , enzymes ( which are proteins or protein complexes ) , and others . The final acceptor of electrons in the electron transport chain during aerobic respiration is molecular oxygen although a variety of acceptors other than oxygen such as sulfate exist in anaerobic respiration .",where do the electrons in the electron transport chain come from,from electron donors,Oxygen,Electron donors.

"Gravitropism ( also known as geotropism ) is a turning or growth movement by a plant or fungus in response to gravity . It is a general feature of all higher and many lower plants as well as other organisms . Charles Darwin was one of the first to scientifically document that roots show positive gravitropism and stems show negative gravitropism . That is , roots grow in the direction of gravitational pull ( i.e. , downward ) and stems grow in the opposite direction ( i.e. , upwards ) . This behavior can be easily demonstrated with any potted plant . When laid onto its side , the growing parts of the stem begin to display negative gravitropism , growing ( biologists say , turning ; see tropism ) upwards . Hebaverns ( non-woody ) stems are capable of a small degree of actual bending , but most of the redirected movement occurs as a consequence of root or stem growth outside .",growth of a plant shoot away from gravity,Gravitropism ( also known as geotropism ),What specific aspect of plant growth away from gravity would you like to know?,Gravitropism.

"The Christian rite of baptism has similarities to Tevilah , a Jewish purification ritual of immersing in water which is required for , among other things , conversion , but differs in that Tevilah is repeatable , while baptism is to be performed only once . John the Baptist , who is considered a forerunner to Christianity , used baptism as the central sacrament of his messianic movement . Christians consider Jesus to have instituted the sacrament of baptism . The earliest Christian baptisms were probably normally by immersion , though other modes may have also been used . By the third and fourth centuries , baptism involved catechetical instruction as well as chrismation , exorcisms , laying on of hands , and recitation of a creed . Affusion became the normal mode of baptism between the twelfth and fourteenth centuries , though immersion was still practiced into the sixteenth . In the sixteenth century , Martin Luther retained baptism as a sacrament , but Swiss reformer Huldrych Zwingli considered baptism and the Lord 's supper to be symbolic .

"Erythropoiesis ( from Greek ' erythro ' meaning `` red '' and ' poiesis ' meaning `` to make '' ) is the process which produces red blood cells ( erythrocytes ) . It is stimulated by decreased O in circulation , which is detected by the kidneys , which then secrete the hormone erythropoietin . This hormone stimulates proliferation and differentiation of red cell precursors , which activates increased erythropoiesis in the hemopoietic tissues , ultimately producing red blood cells . In postnatal birds and mammals ( including humans ) , this usually occurs within the red bone marrow . In the early fetus , erythropoiesis takes place in the mesodermal cells of the yolk sac . By the third or fourth month , erythropoiesis moves to the liver . After seven months , erythropoiesis occurs in the bone marrow . Increased level of physical activity can cause an increase in erythropoiesis . However , in humans with certain diseases and in some animals , erythropoiesis also occurs outside the bone marrow , within the spleen or liver .

"In biology , cell theory is the historic scientific theory , now universally accepted , that living organisms are made up of cells . Cells are the basic unit of structure in all organisms and also the basic unit of reproduction . With continual improvements made to microscopes over time , magnification technology advanced enough to discover cells in the 17th century . This discovery is largely attributed to Robert Hooke , and began the scientific study of cells , also known as cell biology . Over a century later , many debates about cells began amongst scientists . Most of these debates involved the nature of cellular regeneration , and the idea of cells as a fundamental unit of life . Cell theory was eventually formulated in 1839 . This is usually credited to Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann .

"The Underground Railroad was a network of secret routes and safe houses established in the United States during the early to mid-19th century , and used by African - American slaves to escape into free states and Canada with the aid of abolitionists and allies who were sympathetic to their cause . The term is also applied to the abolitionists , both black and white , free and enslaved , who aided the fugitives . Various other routes led to Mexico or overseas . An earlier escape route running south toward Florida , then a Spanish possession ( except 1763 -- 83 ) , existed from the late 17th century until Florida became a United States territory in 1821 ( and ending the safe haven for escaped slaves was the main reason it changed nationality ) . However , the network now generally known as the Underground Railroad was formed in the late 1700s , ran north to the free states and Canada , and reached its height between 1850 and 1860 .
